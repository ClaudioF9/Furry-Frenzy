# The Unstoppable Hero Database

## Overview

First project in the Front-end web developer bootcamp. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

## Challenge

With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You will also continue to learn about agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You will implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

You will write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project as a means to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

## User Story
As a lover of all things superhero related, I want to:
*   Search for a super hero to see all the information related to that superhero (names, aliases, etc)
*   At the same time I would also like the site to display any movies related to that superhero (provides plot and other information)
*   Have several superheroes randomly generated as featured heroes when refreshing the site
*   Have a search history generated for my previously searched 

## Installation
